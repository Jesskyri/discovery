Working with the product team

Design Decisions:

Turning user stories into Cucumber
“As a researcher
I want to indicate the thing I want to edit in the preview
So that I can go directly to that page”   As a researcher when I see the researcher screen there is an yes/no field for others researchers visible
And it's default value is 'No'
And the other researchers section is not shown
As a researcher when I see the researcher screen there is an yes/no field for others researchers visible
And if the user has previously selected yes the 'Yes' value is selected
And the other researchers section is shown
As a researcher when I see the researcher screen
And I change the 'other researcher' option from 'No' to 'Yes'
Then the other researcher section is shown


Job Story:
When I have filled in my research session details
I want to see a preview of the consent form content
So I can check that it is accurate and displays the way I want to.

#ALPHA

The 'Alpha' phase of the consent-form builder has been the first example of handing a project over between the service design and product teams.

This has involved changes to working practices, as well as changes to the overall product. 

## Changes to working practices

### Turning user stories into Cucumber
<<Niklas: two words on this?>>

### Different approach to Trello
<<Niklas?>>
From Old user needs and stories board https://trello.com/b/QTNcy2kO/consent-form-builder-research-and-design to https://trello.com/b/6vlAUkPe/product-team-consent-form 

## Evolution of the tool:
The [tool](https://consent-form.barnardos.digital) went through two main iterations in this phase

### Sprint 0: 
 * Added photos to recording methods
 * Make it clear you’re only building a consent form
 * Language simplified 
 * Removed the need to add participants as consent and information sheets are often created before workers know who the participants are 
 * Information sheet dsiplayed in way that makes it clear what fields have been edited

### Sprint X:
 * Added date on the consent form
 * Give more detail on how and where data is stored and what the consent to it being used for
 * Add incentive information to the info sheet
 * Flow improved
 * Better prompts to enter session and about details
 * 'Minimum Viable Information' agreed
 * Assumption that Barnardo's staff do not need too much prompting around who can consent
 

### Tweaks that are still pending
 * More details for researchers & add more than 2 people
 * Want to edit the information sheet while seeing it ‘as is’
 * Next of kin details
 * How do we do forwards, backwards, returning to edit and overall navigation
 * Should we be using mandatory fields? 
 * How do we do ‘other’ in a way which makes the tool more useful without making it too complex 


## Further research:

* How much competence regarding Barnardo’s staff knowledge of consent are we assuming?
* How do we both ask for and define nuanced consent - especially for data and media permissions
* What is and who is and who sees themselves as gatekeepers?
 * Can we do fully digital consent (wet signature vs tick box)
* How do we use the consent builder to standardise and improve consent in Barnardo’s
 of consent
* Processes differ across department: what should the whole research journey be for Barnardo’s?
* What’s the business case and potential audience
* Open up the tool to other charities?

# Icebox
At the end of the discovery phase, the following questions were deemed still in scope for the overall project, but to be 'ice-boxed' or deemed out of scope for the Alpha phase.

- What should the whole research journey be for Barnardoâ€™s?
- Open up the tool to other charities?
- Potential audience size
- Business case 
- Open source the project?

# Defining who our users are:

During discovery research was carried to define users. It was eventaully decided that it was most intuitive to define users by their roles in the organisation (e.g. a participation worker) than by their role in the recruitment process. Early research into types of users can be found [here](https://trello.com/b/QTNcy2kO/consent-form-builder-research-and-design)

Users were defined as follows:

## Internal users
### Primary: 
- People in Barnardo’s doing research
- Policy, REIT, digital
- People in Barnardo’s doing ‘participation’

### Other groups, slightly different needs :
- Fundraising (140 requested visits in 3 months) 
- Marketing, media & comms

## External users
- People taking part in research
- People giving consent on behalf of a child or young person

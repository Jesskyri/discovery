# Discovery research on users:

## Internal users
### Primary: 
- People in Barnardo’s doing research
- Policy, REIT, digital
- People in Barnardo’s doing ‘participation’

### Other groups, slightly different needs :
- Fundraising (140 requested visits in 3 months) 
- Marketing, media & comms

## External users
- People taking part in research
- People giving consent on behalf of a child or young person

## Deision:
Forgo ‘recruiter’ process personas, for roles people recognise themselves in - e.g.  “as a participation worker”

# User-testing with prototypes:
6 x interviews and testing sessions with internal users

## Research with:

## Quotes
*"I don't know who my participants are"

‘At the first stage of consent I don’t know who anyone’s name is’

‘Use language for a 12 year old’

‘This will print out a form?’

‘We don’t do research’*

## Key commonalities between users:

- Like prepopulation of form
- Flow is still not intuitive (title / description)
- Unlikely to know who users are ahead of time 


## Key differences
- Researcher vs. non-researcher language
- Some users will not necessarily see themselves as ‘doing research’
